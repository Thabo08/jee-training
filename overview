JAVA EE 7 Platform Highlights
 - more annotations, less xml configuration
 - New technologies:
   -----------------
   + Batch applications
   + Concurrency Utilities
   + API for JSON Processing (JSON-P)
   + API for WebSocket
 - New features for EJB components
 - New features for servlets
 - New features for JavaServer Faces (JSF) components
 - New features for the Java Message Service (JMS)

JEE Components:
 - Application clients and applets - components that run on the client
 - Servlets, JSF, JSP - web components that run on the server
 - EJB components - business components than run on the server

Containers - the interface between a component and the low level, platform specific functionality that supports the component
Deployment process installs Java EE application components in the JEE containers

Resource Injection
-------------------
Resource - a program object that provides connections to such systems as db servers and messaging systems
Java Naming & Directory Interface (JNDI), enables components to locate other components and resources
@Resource - annotation used to inject a resource in an application (under the hood, the JNDI API is used to get the resource)
@Resource annotation is in the javax.annotation package
Resource injection is not typesafe as it resolves by name - the resource object is unknown at compile time

Packaging
---------
EAR - contains JEE modules and optionally a deployment descriptor
Deployment descriptor - defines deployment settings for an application, JEE module or component
JEE module contains one or more components of the same container type and optionally one deployment descriptor of that type
WAR - contains enterprise bean class files in the WEB-INF/classes directory, or the jar in the WEB-INF/lib directory
RAR - resource adapter archive store Java classes, XML files and other objects for the JEE Connection Architecture (JCA)
RAR can de deployed as a standalone component or as part of a larger application
