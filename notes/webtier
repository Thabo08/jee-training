Web Tier
--------

Web application - a dynamic extension of a web or application server

Types of web applications:
--------------------------
1. Presentation oriented - contains markup language and dynamic content in response to a request
2. Service oriented - exposes an endpoint to serve calls to the web application

Servlets - Java classes that process requests and construct responses.
Servlets are normally used for service oriented web apps
Java Server Faces are normally used for presentation oriented web apps (can generate text based markup)

JSF Scopes
----------

 + Request(@RequestScoped) - persists during a single HTTP request in a web application. Identifies a class as a managed bean
 + Session(@SessionScoped) - persists across multiple HTTP requests in a web app
 + Application(@ApplicationScoped) - persists across all users' interactions with a web app
